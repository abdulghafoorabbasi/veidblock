# veidblock


Note: please send email to abdul.ghafoor@ri.se for more information or if you are interested to compile and build the code. There are some dependences (due to licensing issues) issues which can be resolved through direct interaction. 
This project is developed by a team member at Acreo to demonstrate the concepts of the verifiable identities and its usage in DLT, specifically related to the open and close relay. This code only contains packages required for DLT, authentication and veidblock.
