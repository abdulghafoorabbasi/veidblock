# veidblock

Note: please send email to abdul.ghafoor@ri.se for more information or if you are interested to compile and build the code. There are some dependencies which require additional proprietary components developed by Acreo (due to licensing issues). Please contact the above if you want to know more about it and want to use in academic and research projects. This project is developed by a team member at Acreo to demonstrate the concepts of the verifiable identities and its usage in DLT, specifically related to the open and close relay. This code only contains packages required for DLT, authentication and veidblock.
